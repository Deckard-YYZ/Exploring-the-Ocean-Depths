Nodules are metal deposits that contain primarily manganese hydroxides
Real nodules can only be found on flat areas of the ocean floor, not on ridges!
They also contain iron, nickel, copper, titanium, and cobalt
Nodules grow around a nucleus, such as a shark's tooth or a piece of shell
It takes 1 million years for a nodule to grow 2-10 mm
The size of nodules can range from 20 cm across to being visible only with a microscope
Manganese nodules were first discovered in the Arctic Ocean in 1868
Nodules can be found in most oceans, with notable deposits in the Pacific and Indian Oceans
Nodules can improve soil quality by sequestering toxic heavy metals like lead
Nodules fields contain a variety of abyssal fauna, which live attached to nodules or around them
There is likely more manganese in the oceans than on land
Nodules could be harvested using underwater vehicles similar to potato harvesters
Mining these nodules stirs up sediment, which can cover and kill sea organisms
Creatures like snails, worms, and sea cucumbers will be killed by the nodule harvester
The noise of nodule mining will force marine animals to flee their habitats
The wastewater from the nodule cleaning process could cloud waters and kill algae and plankton
